# Game of Othello

Please note: `agent.py` is the file that contains all the decision-making logic and algorithms for the AI.

This is an implementation of the game of Othello that includes a challenging opponent that reacts to user input and makes decisions using artificial intelligence. The minimax algorithm allows the opponent to make the best moves by simulating the progression of the game into the future, and the alpha-beta pruning algorithm improves the performance of the minimax algorithm by selectively ignoring game states that will not appear during the gameplay. This implementation of the game also includes caching, allowing the opponent to quickly retrieve information about game states that have appeared previously.
